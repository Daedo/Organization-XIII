# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for *wanting* to contribute to this project!

There are generally three ways to contribute:

## 1. Bug Reports
If you have found a bug in the project it would be incredible, if you could create an issue for this bug. 
The issue should contain a description of the bug (i.e. what happened that you think shouldn't have happened) as well as
a way of reproducing this bug (i.e. what did you do to trigger this behavior / what do I have to do to get this behavior).

## 2. Feature Requests
Similar to bug reports, feature requests aim to improve the project in some way. 
Like with bugs, you can simply create an issue for each feature request you have. 
A feature request should contain information about what new feature you want, 
as well as a reasoning why you think this is a good/ useful feature.

## 3. Improvements
If you want to go the extra mile, you can straight up commit code to the project. 
You can do this by forking the project, and then creating a pull request for a change. 
Note that for a pull request to be accepted it should meet some criteria:
1) The pull request addresses an issue (you can also just create one for it).
2) The change to the code is documented, so we know what you did.
3) The change of the code is tested, especially if you introduce new features.
